# Face-Detection-using-OpenCV-Haar-Cascade-Classifier
Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method.

OpenCV comes with a trainer as well as detector. If you want to train your own classifier for any object like car, planes etc. you can use OpenCV to create one.

The provided code successfully detects the Human face and creates a rectangular boundary over the face.

The XML file can be downloaded from Internet. It's availabe by same name :"haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml"

To end the detection process, press 'Q' Key.

To run the code, please make sure that the latest version of Python, Jupyter and aforementioned libraries are installed in your system.
